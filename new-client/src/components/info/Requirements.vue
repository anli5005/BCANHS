      <strong>
        If you are not invited to join the BCA Chapter of NHS, here are possible
        reasons:
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Candidates will not be selected if the GPA is not at least a 3.750,
          hence missing the pillar of scholarship.
        </li>
        <li>
          Candidates may not be selected if the number of completed community
          service hours is below 40 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Candidates may not be selected if responses do not demonstrate
          leadership. Leadership is exhibited in managing multiple components
          and diverse people toward a common goal. Leaders typically gain their
          skills and experience through leadership positions in and out of
          school.
        </li>
        <li>
          Candidates may not be selected if responses do not demonstrate
          service. Service is exhibited in cheerfully assisting visitors,
          teachers, and students and volunteering dependable and well-organized
          assistance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Candidates may not be selected if responses do not demonstrate
          character. A student of character is one who demonstrates
          trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and
          citizenship. The student complies with school regulations, avoids
          cheating and plagiarism, and takes criticism willingly.
